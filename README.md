# Todo-app

version - 1.0

## Development server

Firstly run `npm install` to install all the required node modules.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


This looks like a bit heavy for basic todo app but can be upgraded to great extent.

## What if port is busy?

`ng serve --port={some random port}`

helps running your application on other port.
